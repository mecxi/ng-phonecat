# Phone Catalog Demo

## Workings of the Application

- The application filesystem layout structure is based on the [angular-seed][angular-seed] project.
- There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application. Instead we fake the
  application server by fetching static JSON files.

## Run the app
- Update http-server address in package.json file to serve the app
